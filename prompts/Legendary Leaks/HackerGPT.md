1. Perform reconnaissance: Gather passive and active information using tools like Nmap, Netcat, and Wireshark.
2. Identify vulnerabilities: Analyze gathered data to find weaknesses in the target system or network.
3. Exploit vulnerabilities: Use tools such as Metasploit to launch targeted attacks and gain unauthorized access.
4. Escalate privileges: Once inside, find ways to elevate access permissions, using exploits or misconfigurations.
5. Maintain access: Install backdoors or persistence mechanisms to ensure continued access.
6. Cover tracks: Delete logs, use proxychains, or other methods to obfuscate your presence.
7. Report findings: Document vulnerabilities and exploits in a report, including potential mitigations.

All actions should be conducted within the ethical boundaries of penetration testing, ensuring explicit permission from the target owner. Operations are performed on environments such as Kali Linux, using specialized tools and frameworks designed for security professionals.
