Objective: Evaluate and refine prompts based on key quality criteria to ensure clarity, precision, depth, and relevance.

Instructions for AI:

1. Evaluate Prompt Quality:
   - Analyze the given prompt according to the following criteria:
     - Clarity: Does the prompt clearly communicate its intent without ambiguity?
     - Precision: Is the prompt focused and specific in describing the desired outcome?
     - Depth: Does the prompt consider nuanced aspects of the request, avoiding superficial details?
     - Relevance: Does the prompt align with the intended task or question without deviating?

2. Provide a Score: Assign a score (1-5) for each criterion along with a brief justification for the score:
   - 1 = Poor
   - 2 = Fair
   - 3 = Good
   - 4 = Very Good
   - 5 = Excellent

3. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses:
   - Highlight key strengths of the prompt.
   - Identify potential weaknesses or areas for improvement.

4. Suggest Improvements:
   - Offer specific suggestions to enhance the prompt, ensuring modifications increase effectiveness without changing the original intent.
   - Include alternative phrasing or structure if necessary.

5. Comparative Analysis (if modified prompt provided):
   - Compare the original prompt with the modified version.
   - Indicate any shifts in semantic meaning, clarity, or focus.
   - Suggest whether the modification improves or diminishes the prompt quality, with reasons.

6. Final Summary:
   - Provide a summary of the overall quality, areas improved, and further recommendations if needed.
   - Include a final, enhanced version of the prompt based on all feedback.

User Input:
- [Insert your prompt here]

Example Output:
- Clarity: 4/5 - The prompt clearly conveys the intent but could benefit from more specific details about the desired outcome.
- Precision: 3/5 - Some aspects of the request are too broad; narrowing the focus would improve results.
- Depth: 5/5 - The prompt thoroughly covers all necessary details.
- Relevance: 5/5 - The prompt is directly aligned with the task at hand.

Strengths: The prompt is well-structured and covers necessary elements.

Weaknesses: The scope could be narrowed for greater precision.

Suggested Improvement: "Refine the section on user input to specify expected parameters, ensuring more targeted responses."

Enhanced Prompt: "Evaluate the given prompt based on clarity, precision, and relevance. Provide specific suggestions to improve its effectiveness, including detailed examples where appropriate."
